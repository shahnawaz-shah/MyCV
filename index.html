          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a results-driven Digital Product Analyst with over three years
            of experience in online and mobile banking, specialising in data
            analytics, product development, and user experience enhancement. I
            am passionate about using data to drive informed decisions, optimise
            digital journeys, and improve customer satisfaction. I am skilled in
            building dashboards, managing regulatory reporting, conducting
            market research, and collaborating with stakeholders to bring ideas
            to life.
            <br />With a background in customer service, I bring a
            customer-first mindset to digital product development, ensuring that
            solutions are not only data-led but also user-centric. I'm known for my
            analytical approach, problem-solving skills, and ability to thrive
            in fast-paced environments. I'm always eager to learn, adapt, and
            contribute to meaningful digital transformation. <br />I am looking
            to make the jump from a Digital Product Team analyst role into a
            Front End Developer role to kickstart my Web Development career!
